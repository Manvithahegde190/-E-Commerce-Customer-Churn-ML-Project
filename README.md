# E-Commerce-Customer-Churn-ML-Project
This project aims to predict customer churn in the e-commerce industry using machine learning. The goal is to build a model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This will help the company proactively engage with at-risk customers to reduce churn.

Project Description
The project involves the following steps:

    Data Exploration: Analyzing customer characteristics and their relationship with churn.
    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and converting variables to appropriate data types.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the relationship between variables to identify correlations and patterns.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, selecting the most important variables.
    Machine Learning Modeling: Building predictive models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify customers at risk of leaving.
    Evaluation: Evaluating model performance and identifying key factors influencing churn.
    Insights and Recommendations: Using model predictions and insights about important features to develop effective customer retention strategies.

Project Outcomes:

    Predict customer churn with high accuracy.
    Understand the key drivers of customer churn.
    Improve customer retention strategies.
    Provide actionable insights to stakeholders.
Benefits:

    Reduced customer churn rate.
    Increased customer lifetime value.
    Improved customer satisfaction.
    Enhanced business profitability
